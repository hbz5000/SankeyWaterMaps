            <abstract>This feature class contains service
area polygons for each Community Water System (CWS). To determine the service
area, ADWR utilized primary data provided directly from the water system (i.e.
PDF, shapefile, verbal definition). If primary data is unavailable, secondary
data was utilized to determine service area boundaries (i.e. Certificate of
Convenience and Necessity (CCN), Census Designated Place shapefile from U.S
Census Bureau.) 

New water systems are added, and
contact information is updated for existing water systems on an annual basis.
Service area maps are updated every 5 years. ADWR cannot verify the spatial
accuracy of the information contained on this map. 

The most recent annual update was
3/24/2022.

The most recent service area update
was 3/24/2022.</abstract>
            <purpose>The purpose of this feature class is to provide service area boundaries for community water systems regulated by the Arizona Department of Water Resources.</purpose>
